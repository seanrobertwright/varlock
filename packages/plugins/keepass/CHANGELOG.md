# @varlock/keepass-plugin




## 2.0.1
<sub>2026-08-08</sub>

- [#53](https://github.com/seanrobertwright/varlock/pull/53)  *(patch)* Thanks [@app/pull](https://github.com/app/pull)!
  Fix opening KeePass databases, which failed with `errorHandler object is no longer supported`. Also defer database setup until a `kp()`/`kpBulk()` call actually runs, so an unused instance with an empty master password no longer fails the whole schema.

## 2.0.0
<sub>2026-06-23</sub>

- [#817](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/817)  *(major)* - **Breaking:** the service-account / auth token data types are now `@internal` by default — varlock still uses them to fetch your other secrets, but they are no longer injected into your application. If your app reads one of these credentials directly (e.g. to write secrets back or fetch more at runtime), set `@internal=false` to keep it injected.
- [#818](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/818)  *(patch)* - Report anonymous, non-sensitive usage attributes (auth mode, feature flags) through varlock's opt-out telemetry.
