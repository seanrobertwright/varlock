# @varlock/akeyless-plugin






## 2.0.1
<sub>2026-08-22</sub>

- [#65](https://github.com/seanrobertwright/varlock/pull/65)  *(patch)* Thanks [@app/pull](https://github.com/app/pull)!
  Fix package.json entry points - remove references to files that were never built and declare import/require conditions explicitly

## 2.0.0
<sub>2026-06-23</sub>

- [#817](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/817)  *(major)* - **Breaking:** the service-account / auth token data types are now `@internal` by default — varlock still uses them to fetch your other secrets, but they are no longer injected into your application. If your app reads one of these credentials directly (e.g. to write secrets back or fetch more at runtime), set `@internal=false` to keep it injected.
- [#818](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/818)  *(patch)* - Report anonymous, non-sensitive usage attributes (auth mode, feature flags) through varlock's opt-out telemetry.

## 1.2.0
<sub>2026-06-10</sub>

- [#577](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/577)  *(minor)* - Add opt-in disk caching via the `cacheTtl` init param (e.g. `cacheTtl="1h"`, `cacheTtl=forever`; setting it to `false` or an empty string disables caching). Cache keys include a hash of the account-identifying instance config (account, region, project, environment, etc.) so projects pointing the same plugin at different backends can never read each other's cached values from the shared per-user cache.
  Akeyless caches static secret values only — dynamic and rotated secrets are designed to change per fetch and are never cached.
